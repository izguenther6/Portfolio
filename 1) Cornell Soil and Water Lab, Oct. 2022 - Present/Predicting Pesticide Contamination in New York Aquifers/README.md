# Predicting Pesticide Contamination in New York Aquifers with Machine Learning ðŸŒ±ðŸ’¦ðŸ—½

*Please note that the code/output is currently confidential.  
We will be publishing reports/papers soon.*

SUMMARY
- over the past 3 years, the Cornell Soil & Water Lab has collaborated with the NYSDEC to test groundwater samples around the state for pesticide contamination

- we are now using this data to build machine learning models that predict pesticide leaching events...since the code/output is currently confidential, here's a list of key components being implemented:
  - XGBoost binary classification
  - KFold cross-validation with hyperparameter/decision threshold threshold tuning
  - ordinal feature engineering for categorical data
  - SHAP importance analysis
  - adjustments for imbalanced class labels

- more info on the overall project can be found here: https://soilandwaterlab.cornell.edu/upstate-new-york-pesticides-in-water-2021-2025/
