## Summary
- over the past 3 years, the Cornell Soil & Water Lab has collaborated with the NYSDEC to test groundwater samples around the state for pesticide contamination

- the data is now being used to build machine learning models that predict pesticide leaching events...since the code is currently confidential, here's a list of key components being implemented:
  - XGBoost binary classification
  - KFold cross-validation with hyperparameter/decision threshold threshold tuning
  - ordinal feature engineering for categorical data
  - SHAP importance analysis
  - adjustments for imbalanced class labels
  - comparison to theoretical models
