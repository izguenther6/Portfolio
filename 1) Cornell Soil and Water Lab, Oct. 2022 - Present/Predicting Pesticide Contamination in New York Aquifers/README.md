Repository link: https://github.com/izguenther6/orie4741-final

SUMMARY
- over the past 3 years, the Cornell Soil & Water Lab has collaborated with the NYDEC to test groundwater        samples around the state for pesticide contamination

- we are now using this data to build machine learning models that predict pesticide leaching events

- this is an ON-GOING PROJECT, however, I used this work to satisfy the requirements of ORIE 4741: Learning      with Big, Messy Data...this is why the repository is titled "orie4741-final"...the final class report can be   found in the repository

- more info on the overall project can be found here: https://soilandwaterlab.cornell.edu/wp-content/uploads/static/dec-web/
