Repository Link: https://github.com/izguenther6/prodairy/tree/main/covered%20storage%20mass%20balances

SUMMARY
- this code used local weather data and empirical manure evaporation equations to perform mass balances on       precipitation in covered manure storages around upstate New York

- the mass balance results were then used to evaluate the economic efficacy of the covered manure storages
